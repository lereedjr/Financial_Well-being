# Financial Well-being Survey Analysis

## Intorduction
I will be analyzing survey data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The survey data was released in October 2017. The survey website can be found at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Financial Well-being survey website.] (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/financial-well-being-survey-data/)

After looking at and ready about the different survey items I decided to analyze the FS Score, which I'm call the financial stability score and have pared down the data from over 200 varaibles to a manageable 26. I'm using these 25 varabiles to discover if there are groups within the financial stablity score. If there are groups I will anser two more questions, what are they commonalitiles and are their FS Scores different. 

The varaibles I'm using are:
* SWB_1, I am satisfied with my life 
* SWB_2, I am optimistic about my future 
* SWB_3, If I work hard today, I will be more successful in the future 
* HOUSING, Which one of the following best describes your housing situation? 
* LIVINGARRANGEMENT, Current living arrangements 
* SAVINGSRANGES, How much money do you have in savings today...?  
* EARNERS, Household members currently contributing to paying household bills 
* MANAGE2, Who in household makes financial decisions 
* PAREDUC, Highest level of education by person/people who raised respondent 
* HHEDUC, Highest level of education of all household members
